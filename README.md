# Classification-Regression-Clustering-ACP-ACM-using-R-with-report
Project Description:

This project involves the application of various statistical and machine learning techniques using the R programming language. The primary focus is on data analysis and exploration, including classification, regression, clustering (utilizing K-means and hierarchical clustering), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).

The project includes the following key components:

Classification: This aspect of the project involves building predictive models to classify data into different categories or classes. Statistical tests such as p-values may be used to assess the significance of the predictors.

Regression: Regression analysis is employed to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Statistical tests and p-values are often used to assess the significance of the regression coefficients.

Clustering (K-means and CAH): Clustering techniques are utilized to group similar data points together. K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering (CAH) are applied to segment the data into meaningful clusters.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important information. It helps identify patterns and relationships in the data.

Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA): MCA is a multivariate statistical technique used for analyzing relationships between categorical variables. It is particularly useful in exploring complex datasets with categorical variables.

Throughout the project, various statistical tests, including p-values, are employed to assess the significance of findings and results. The project concludes with the generation of a comprehensive report that summarizes the methodologies used, the results obtained, and the interpretation of those results. This report will provide valuable insights into the dataset and the effectiveness of the applied statistical and machine learning techniques.

Overall, this project demonstrates a holistic approach to data analysis and modeling using R, incorporating a wide range of statistical methods to extract meaningful information and draw actionable conclusions from the data.
